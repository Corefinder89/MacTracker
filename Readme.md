# NMAP
<b>NMAP</b> (Network Mapper) is a command that can help users discover hosts and services on a computer network. I have used `NMAP` as a service in my application to identify devices that are connected over the network. To install `NMAP` within your system I would suggest my viewers to install `ZENMAP` which is just a GUI wrapper over the `NMAP` command. It would help harness the capabilities of `NMAP` over a light weight GUI. To get `ZENMAP` installed in your system just follow the [link](https://nmap.org/zenmap/). Since I am using a mac environment to set up my application I just downloaded the required version of Zenmap, extracted it and placed it in my application directory. But before installing the application `NMAP` into your mac please check that your machine has the permission to install applications outside your app store. To do that just visit `System Preferences -> Security -> Click on "Anywhere"` To check whether `NMAP` has properly been installed in your machine just run the command `nmap --version`.
